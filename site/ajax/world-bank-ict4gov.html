		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">The World Bank’s ICT4Gov initiative is a knowledge base for government  practitioners to share information and resources to encourage use of Information and  Communication Technologies (ICT) for better governance. The World Bank Institute is  facilitating such initiatives in a number of pilot participatory budgeting projects in  the Dominican Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">The Dominican Republic is one of the few countries in the world to have  institutionalized through its Constitution participatory budgeting (PB), a  process in which non-elected citizens participate in the decision-making process  of budget allocation. The ICT4Gov program promotes the use of ICT as a means  to reinforce the inclusiveness and transparency of participatory budgeting processes  in the country, starting with two pilots in the Municipality of Bani and Jarabacoa.  Furthermore, working central government agencies and a broad coalition of national  stakeholders, ICT4Gov is currently developing a mobile enabled citizen feedback  mechanism to promote accountability and better delivery of public services.
