		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">XPRIZEs are massive financial awards provided by the XPRIZE Foundation and a  variety of private sector sponsors for solutions to audacious problems. The  prizes are used to incentivize projects that could benefit humanity. Prizes  are given out following a competition, wherein individuals propose potential  projects or solutions to public problems. For example, the Ansari XPRIZE for  space exploration is one of the most famous examples of prize-induced contests. <br/> XPRIZEs are awarded in five different groups: Education, Energy and Environment, Exploration, Global Development and Life Sciences. Currently active XPRIZEs  include the Google Lunar XPRIZE, Archon Genomics XPRIZE presented by Express  Scripts, Qualcomm Tricorder XPRIZE and the Nokia Sensing XPRIZE. Already awarded  XPRIZEs include the Ansari XPRIZE, Progressive Insurance Automotive XPRIZE, Wendy  Schmidt Oil Cleanup XCHALLENGE and the Northrop Grumman Lunar Lander XCHALLENGE.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Chairman and CEO Peter Diamandis first announced the Ansari XPRIZE in 1996.  The $10 million prize for building and launching a spacecraft capable of  carrying three people to 100 kilometers above the earth’s surface, twice  within two weeks, was awarded to Scaled Composites on October 4, 2004.  Following the success of the project, the XPRIZE Foundation grew and began  offering prizes in a wider variety of areas.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">The scope and difficulty of XPRIZE challenges traditionally lead to teams or  organizations winning the prize, as was the case with the original Ansari XPRIZE.  However, considering the level of complexity involved in each challenge,  unaffiliated individuals could possibly provide useful input if given the  opportunity to collaborate, but the website provides no on-site means of  collaboration or team building.
