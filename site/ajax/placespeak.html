		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">PlaceSpeak is a public consultation platform, mainly for city governments,  that features a user verification system that ensures everyone taking part in a  consultation project has a connection with the relevant geographic area. <br/> PlaceSpeak features consultation opportunities split into four central topic  categories: government, private sector, community and agency. So while the platform  is likely best known for its use by city governments, any member can create a public  consultation entry for their organization. <br/> PlaceSpeak “advances public consultation to a whole new level by enabling evidence-based  decision-making by allowing citizens to influence the process in an open, safe, secure  and transparent manner.” <br/> PlaceSpeak requires users to create profiles with verified geographic information to ensure  that they only partake in consultation opportunities relevant to them. When signing up,  users have the option to receive a notification every time a new opportunity is created in their area. <br/> On the Explore Topics tab, a Google Map shows currently available consultation projects, which can be filtered by their color-coded by their topic area. The page also has featured topics, popular topics near the users location, recently added topics and a sidebar allowing users to browse by suggested topics,  categories, organizations and popular tags. <br/> Topic pages feature customizable tabs, which can include an overview; a discussion board; resources,  like instructive PDFs or links; notification board; and upcoming events. A “Connect with this topic”  button appears at the top of each page. A sidebar shows the number of times the topic profile has been viewed, the number of connected participants and the organization’s contact information. Since PlaceSpeak is a  customizable platform, topic overviews are not uniform. Some options include links to off-site surveys or  sign-up forms, media coverage of the topic or on-site polls. Each page, however, features a module at the  top with a Google Map showing where the consultation is based and a bulleted list of “How you can help.” <br/> As a customizable platform, PlaceSpeak can, in many ways, become whatever is needed for a particular consultation  project. The geographic verification system ensures that people engaging with a consultation are in fact from the  relevant area.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">As of May 2013, each of PlaceSpeak’s limited consultation opportunities are based  in Canada. While the site can be used for single initiatives, as a platform, a  growing network of participating organizations and governments is likely necessary  for the site to be valuable.
