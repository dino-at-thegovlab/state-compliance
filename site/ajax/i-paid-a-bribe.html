		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Janaagraha is a non-profit that works for improving the quality of  citizenship and infrastructure and services in India’s cities. Janaagraha  runs two on-line platforms, ICHangeMyCity.com and IPaidABribe.com.  IPaidABribe.com is a platform provided to citizens to crowd source bribe  experiences. It is a citizen driven mechanism for tracking bribe payment  activity, also instances of when people resisted bribe payments or did  not have to pay bribes because of good government systems or good people  within the government systems. Citizens’ reports on the nature, number,  pattern, types, locations and frequency of actual corrupt acts and values  of bribes will add up to a valuable knowledge bank that will contribute  to a reduction in bribe payments. <br/> By providing a place for citizens to report, as well as by analyzing the  information, ipaidabribe.com aims to * Heighten citizen awareness about the nature and spread of bribe-related  exchanges and promote a purposive public debate that pressurises public  officials to reduce and eventually eliminate corruption. * Help citizens to recognize, avoid and tackle bribe paying situations. * Identify and analyse the workflows within corruption prone public services,  to make suggestions on systemic reform directed at entrenching simpler and  more transparent processes, more consistent standards of law enforcement  and better vigilance and regulation.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Historical Information</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">The ipaidabribe.com idea has emerged and evolved over time. It commenced  with a discussion between co-founders of Janaagraha, Swati and Ramesh  Ramanathan and Mr. Sridar Iyengar, a board member of Janaagraha’s advisory  board a couple of years back regarding the pernicious effect of corruption  on destroying city life and disempowering citizens. The original idea was  that the website could become a simple means of tracking the market price  of corruption - a kind of market price prediction mechanism. A small  experimental website was put up to test the idea. However the afterthought  was that such an effort was indeed a very powerful one. Over time, we worked  on the idea extensively and added a lot more features. We decided that the  website has to be a multifaceted site, providing a variety of services to  people. We launched the new completely redesigned website on Aug 15, 2010,  India’s Independence day.  <br/> IPaidABribe.com (IPAB) is an initiative to tackle corruption by tapping  into the collective energy of citizens, almost every one of whom is either  a victim, perpetrator or beneficiary, or a combination of these. Janaagraha  has a very rigorous system of aligning its institutional objectives with  the performance of its programmes. Each institutional objective is further  aligned with several strategic themes. Ipab aligns with Janaagraha’s goal  of making a measurable difference in the quality of Citizenship in cities.  It does this by adopting the strategy of empowering citizens using a  net-plus- roots approach – we use a net based platform for recording the  grassroots experiences of citizens. Through this approach, ipaidabribe.com  aligns completely with Janaagraha’s key thrust of increasing the number of  citizen change agents in the city. We believe that every citizen who reports  a story on our website about paying a bribe, is angry enough to begin to  resist it. Of course, it goes without saying that somebody who has resisted  paying a bribe and reported the story, is already very much on the path of  being a citizen change agent.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Lessons Learned</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Any offline platform needs a strong offline plan . Also structured support in the  form of marketing, both online and offline leads to a sustained process,  rather than a one off campaign.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Challenges</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">The biggest challenge for IPaidaBribe.com is to respond to the demands of the public,  to provide support and information quickly. As this is a web based initiative,  it is important that we respond to people very fast. For this purpose, one needs  to collect data from the government, analyse government procedures and present the  findings in a simple manner. At any given time, we are undertaking research on at  least two to three important government procedures or departments.
