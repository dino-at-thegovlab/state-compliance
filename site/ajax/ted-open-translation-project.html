		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Launched in 2009, the Open Translation Project was initially seeded with 300  translations in 40 languages, with translators in cities across the globe. While  the initial translations were completed by professionals, all future translations  will be completed by volunteers. In order to ensure quality of translations, TED  provides an approved, professional English transcript for every talk, upon which  all volunteer translations are based. Before a translation is published, it must  be reviewed by a second translator fluent in the language. Translations can be  continually improved via a feedback mechanism embedded in the site.
