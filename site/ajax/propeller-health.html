		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Propeller Health is a mobile platform for respiratory health management  designed to help patients and their physicians better understand and control  respiratory disease to reduce preventable emergency room visits and hospitalizations. <br/> Propeller applies data to solve one of the most pressing public health concerns  – asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) – including sharing data,  putting data in the hands of patients, leveraging aggregated and anonymous data and  linking health data to place. Through sensors, mobile apps and services, Propeller  aims to reduce the cost of care while delivering better quality of life for individuals  with chronic respiratory disease. Asthma and COPD diseases are unique in that patients  carry their inhalers with them and use them at the time and place when they have symptoms.  The sensor is a small device that attaches to the top of the existing inhaler and can be used with both rescue and controller medications for tracking symptoms and adherence  respectively. The objective data it collects, and the personalized feedback patients get as a result, can help them and their physicians to better understand and manage these  conditions by tracking how often they use their medication and by setting up medication  reminders and alerts.
