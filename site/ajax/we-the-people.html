		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">We the People was launched on September 22, 2011 by the Obama administration.  The platform was designed to provide Americans with a new mechanism to submit  petitions to the Government regarding various issues.  In its first months of  operation, the threshold that a petition needed to reach in order to obtain an official response was of 5,000 signatures. Because of the quick and high rate  of participation in the portal the signature threshold was raised to a 100,000  signatures. The first official response to a petition created on We the People  was given one month after the launching of the site, and responded to a petition  to reduce the burden of student loans. In 2012, the source code for We the  People was published making it available for people all around the world who  wish to implement their own petitioning platform. The most popular content on  the Whitehouse.gov webpage was a response to the petition created in We the  People to start the construction of a “Death Star”, the military battle-station  of Star Wars. A petition submitted to the portal regarding the legalization  of unlocking cellphones was pushed forward by the White House, which resulted  in the Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless Competition Act.
