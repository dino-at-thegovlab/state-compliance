		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Ushahidi is a free, open source interactive mapping platform that can draw in a wide variety of data streams to visually present location-based information. It was originally developed in response to post-election violence in Kenya in  2008 and has since been used for a wide variety of humanitarian and civic ends.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Ushahidi, which means “testimony” in Swahili, was originally developed by an  ad hoc group of volunteers in 2008 to help map reports of violence following  the Kenyan election.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Challenges</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">The Ushahidi website provides a wealth of information for developers, but little guidance for people seeking to contribute to a particular deployment.  While the Community section features a map and list of deployments, a more central means of discovery for users could prove beneficial.
