		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Patient Opinion is a national feedback website for the UK National Health Service.  Users can rate their health service experience, view other ratings, and engage  directly with other patients and health providers. <br/> As part of the platform, consumers of health care services share stories from their  experiences with service care providers. These stories are then widely accessible  forms of open data that others may use to make more informed decisions about their health providers. <br/> Patient Opinion is one of the only patient healthcare feedback services for a national healthcare service.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Historical Information</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Patient Opinion was founded in 2005 by Paul Hodgkin, a GP in Sheffield, who wanted  to make the wisdom of patients available to the NHS. The initial phase of  PatientOpinion was funded by the Department of Health and South Yorkshire Strategic  Health Authority. Since 2006, Patient Opinion has been funded through subscriptions  and sales to trusts, commissioners and others. Over 600 organizations subscribe or  are registered with Patient Opinion. <br/> In 2012 they established Patient Opinion Australia and in 2014, Patient Opinion Ireland.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Challenges</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Despite their extensive work, Patient Opinion is not integrated with government  in any official capacity, diminishing its efficacy. The platform itself should  look to improve its user-interface, including adding search functions and access  to raw data.
