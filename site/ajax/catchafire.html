		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Founded in 2010 by former investment banker Rachael Chong, Catchafire is a  New York City-based for-profit company and platform that matches nonprofits  needing assistance on specific projects to skilled volunteers. The inspiration  for Catchafire came when as an employee at UBS, Ms. Chong participated in a  volunteer opportunity that included hauling lumber to a construction site – a  task that did not make use her financial skills. She was inspired to create a  service that would allow professionals to donate their time in a way that  was both most useful for the “receiving” organization, and also career-enhancing  for the volunteer. In 2014, Catchafire became a key partner in LinkedIn’s  new Volunteer Marketplace.
