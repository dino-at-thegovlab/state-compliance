		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">NYC BigApps is New York City's premier open data competition. Created in 2009,  NYC BigApps has helped launch nearly 300 apps that improve the lives of New  York residents, visitors and businesses. The NYC BigApps competition has also  opened up over 1,000 datasets to developers around the world. <br/> As part of the discussion that the crowdsourcing model can tap the possibilities  for digital communication networks to mobilize citizens, foster creative input  and produce plans through democratic processes, which more accurately address  our lived experience within organized networks today. A few scholars studying  collective intelligence in governance,including Clark and Logan cite the  successes of the crowdsourcing platform Ushahidi and of the ideation initiative  NYCBigApps as evidence that crowdsourcing can transform government to be more  engaging, more democratic, and more effective. <br/> The Challenge is also a test of the concept of prize-backed challenges, that  help create the incentive for insightful enthusiasts to emerge from the  woodwork. The use of prizes in the public sector is growing more common, as  evidenced by the New York City’s BigApps challenge, although we still do not  have a strong understanding of their optimal uses.
