		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Zooniverse is a website that houses the various projects run by the Citizen  Science Alliance. <br/> The Zooniverse website connects volunteers, or “zooites,” to a variety of  Citizen Science Alliance’s projects. The original project, Galaxy Zoo, had  volunteers classify galaxies by leading them through on online tutorial of  visual cues to determine galaxy type, testing the participant’s newly acquired  skills with a trial, and finally having the participants apply this knowledge  to unclassified galaxies. While the original Galaxy Zoo project is archived,  there have been several variations including two that are still in progress,  Galaxy Zoo, Hubble and Moon Zoo. <br/> In addition to Galaxy Zoo and its spin-offs, there are many other projects  that deal with astronomical categorization using the same technique of training  volunteers to identify certain characteristics and then use that knowledge to  classify specific celestial objects (galaxies, moons, etc.). The same model  is also utilized for projects in other fields such as ecology, climate science,  and marine biology. In the case of marine biology, the model was adjusted for a  project entitled Whale FM so that participants learned audio instead of visual  cues. There are also multiple transcription projects currently underway,  including Old Weather and Ancient Lives, which rely on volunteers to transcribe  documents. <br/> The Zooniverse/Citizen Science Alliance team determines which projects will  be housed in Zooniverse by having scientists submit proposals through online  questionnaires. Zooniverse works with scientists and scholars from a wide  variety of fields, including astronomy, humanities, climate science, planetary  science, classics, and ecology.
