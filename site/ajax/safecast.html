		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">"Safecast is a global sensor network for collecting and sharing radiation  measurements to empower people with data about their environments." The  organization crowdsources expertise and uses a citizen science model to  collect their data.  <br/> Safecast deploys teams of volunteers to record nuanced data such as  radiation counts per minute, raw levels of radiation, becquerels, and  microsieverts, which together tell a complete story about radiation levels.  Volunteers strap Safecast’s custom ‘bento box’ (referred to as such due to  their resemblance to bento boxes) Geiger counters to their vehicles and  collect radiation data in their communities. Volunteers also use handheld  Geiger counters to collect data on foot. <br/>  Safecast’s fine-grained data collection methodology is particularly  valuable because radiation data levels can vary widely across a single city.  Safecast volunteers collect data street by street and at multiple points  within a single zone, which creates a more nuanced portrait of actual  radiation levels within a region. November 10, 2011. Radiation levels  can even differ between neighborhoods, thus rendering city-level data  only valuable in ascertaining an approximation of radiation levels  city-wide. Collecting data at the neighborhood-level ensures the data  is fine-grained and it provides an accurate profile of threats.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Founded in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi meltdown, Safecast was  created to provide fine-grained radiation data to regions impacted by the  nuclear power plant meltdown. Two years later, the volunteer-run organization  is still leveraging the power of crowdsoucing to provide post-Fukushima  radiation data, but has broadened its scope to provide baseline radiation data  and also measure other environmental factors like air quality. Due to the scale  of the disaster in Fukushima, the majority of the organization’s efforts are  still directed at providing granular radiation data so that those impacted by  the meltdown can make data-driven decisions. <br/> In the aftermath of the 9.0 magnitude earthquake and subsequent meltdown at  the Fukushima nuclear power plant, there was little publicly available data about  radiation levels in Japan. This dearth of radiation data concerned friends Sean  Bonner, Pieter Franken, and Joi Ito, all of whom had close ties to the region.  Geiger counters that enable radiation data collection were in short supply and  little official information about radiation levels was being shared with the  public. Spurred by the gap in readily available radiation data and the short  supply of Geiger counters, Bonner, Franken, and Ito took it upon themselves to  build the hardware they needed to monitor radiation levels in Japan. In  partnership with Tokyo Hackerspace, Safecast designed and built high quality  Geiger counters to enable citizens to collect radiation data within their  communities. <br/>  Constructing the hardware was one element of Safecast’s work. The other  component was assembling an expert network to help monitor the situation  unfolding in Japan. Within a week of the Fukushima disaster Safecast mobilized  a crowdsourced team of 25 experts committed to voluntarily monitor radiation  levels across Japan. This network quickly ballooned to include experts from  around the world, and Safecast rapidly grew to become the largest citizen  science monitoring network of its kind. This rapid growth can be attributed  to a number of factors, but most notably, it was the dearth of official  information on radiation levels that led to citizens creating their  own crowdsourced network.
