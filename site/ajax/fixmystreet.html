The service automatically sends  the citizen reports to the relevant government council upon receipt.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Challenges</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">FixMyStreet features little in the way of community functions, outside  of the ability to provide updates on other’s reported issues. The site  also lacks any ability to browse or search for issues based on any criteria  other than location and relevant government council.
