   99designs is an online platform that connects graphic designers 
   with potential clients by hosting design challenges.
   <br/>
   The company creates their products by crowdsourcing, as customers can 
   solicit designers to submit designs for contests to create products 
   such as websites, t-shirts, or logos. The customer then chooses the best 
   design from the pool of submitted entries and the selected designer will 
   win a cash payment. Customers also have the option of working with individual 
   designers by purchasing design templates from 99designs’ Readymade logo store 
   or by visiting Swiftly for quick graphic design fixes and steal logo's.

   "Back in 2008, 99designs’ Founder Mark Harbottle locked colleagues Lachlan 
   Donald and Paul Annesley in an office in Melbourne to pioneer a new kind 
   of marketplace for graphic design.
   <br/>
   Mark and Matt Mickiewicz, already co-founders of successful online media 
   and publishing company SitePoint, along with Internet pioneer and entrepreneur 
   Leni Mayo and Melbourne IT Non-Executive Director and ex-CEO of Hitwise, 
   Andrew Walsh, became founding investors in the startup.
   <br/>
   Upon launch, 99designs quickly caught the eye of small business owners around 
   the world looking for a fast, affordable alternative to the traditional 
   design process. The service was off to a flying start.
   <br/>
   By 2010, the business had opened offices in San Francisco and won the 
   prestigious Webby People's Voice Award for Best Web Service and 
   Application.
   <br/>
   In April 2011, 99designs announced a $35 million Series A investment 
   to assist with its global expansion. This investment round was led by 
   Accel Partners, with participation from angel investors Michael Dearing 
   (eBay, Harrision Metal), Dave Goldberg (Survey Monkey), Stewart Butterfield
   (Flickr, Tiny Speck) and Anthony Casalena (Squarespace).
   <br/>
   In August 2012, 99designs made its first acquisition, purchasing European 
   creative services marketplace 12designer to help fuel its global growth. 
   Following the acquisition and establishment of its European headquarters 
   in Berlin, 99designs launched localized versions of its services in German, 
   French, Spanish, Dutch and Italian.
   <br/>
   This global expansion continued with the acquisition of LogoChef - one 
   of Brazil's leading design marketplaces - in August 2013.
   <br/>
   That same month, 99designs introduced an entirely different way for 
   businesses to get small design tasks done quickly: Swiftly. The 
   first-of-its-kind service is part of 99designs' broader plan to change 
   the paradigm for how businesses worldwide get graphic design work done 
   and how designers earn money."

   second iteration being in the works.
   <br/> 
   By accepting submissions at every stage, including the idea stage, the 
   Solutions for Stronger Communities competition lowered the barrier for engagement
   for those with potential solutions who lacked the capital or expertise to put 
   their solutions into action. However, this low barrier to entry could also delay 
   the impact of contest winners, since entries could take a significant amount of 
   time and capital to operationalize.

   In his September 2009 Strategy for American Innovation, President Obama called 
   on agencies to increase their ability to promote innovation by using tools 
   such as prizes and challenges to solve tough problems. On March 2010, the 
   Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a memorandum on the use of 
   challenges/contests and prizes to improve government and encourage innovation, 
   including a promise to make a web-based platform for prizes and challenges 
   within 120 days.
   <br/>
   The OMB memo also promised that the administration would '…make available

   The Consumer Complaint Database launched on June 2013, following the 
   formation of the CFPB in July 2011, which continues to oversee site 
   management. The CFPB was founded as a result of the Dodd–Frank Wall 
   Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which passed in response 
   to the Late-2000s recession and financial crisis. The bureau began 
   operation on July 21, 2011. Congress established the CFPB to protect 
   consumers by carrying out federal consumer financial laws. The CFPB 
   seeks to ensure that consumers get the information they need to make 
   the financial decisions they believe are best for themselves and their 
   families, that prices are clear up front, that risks are visible and 
   that nothing is buried in fine print. The agency has the power to write 
   rules, supervise companies, and enforce federal consumer financial 
   protection laws; restrict unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices; 
   take consumer complaints; promote financial education; research consumer 
   behavior; monitor financial markets for new risks to consumers; and 
   enforce laws that outlaw discrimination and other unfair treatment in 
   consumer finance.

   In the summer of 2012, the CFPB asked for public comment on adding 
   complaints about other consumer financial products and services under 
   its authority to the Consumer Complaint Database and received a wide 
   range of comments from interested stakeholders.

   As of February 2014, the agency has received over 300,000 complaints.

   Drive BC offers nothing in the way of metrics regarding the use and impact

  impact_longer_term:

   Drive BC’s citizen reporting functionality does not feature any on-site 
   means of citizen input. For all issues, citizens are directed to contact 
   information, notably telephone numbers, with no option for simply typing 
   in a description of the issue and the address directly from the Web or 
   mobile. While this capability exists using the DriveBC Twitter account, 
   it is questionable whether citizens would ascertain this fact from visiting 
   the desktop or mobile Drivebc.ca site.
   <br/>
   Drive BC’s ability to guide citizen input regarding issues on different 
   types of provincial roads and highways, as well as wildfires, chemical 
   spills and downed power lines could go unnoticed by citizens because the 
   link to report such issues is subtly presented on the site. Moreover, 
   the link citizens need to click, on mobile or desktop, is confusingly 
   labeled “Report a Highway Problem.” Based on this subtlety and misleading 
   label, citizens attempting to report a wildfire or a pothole on a municipal 
   road could easily assume that Drive BC is not the correct place to make 
   such a report.

  url: http://fold.it/portal/
  description: > 
   Foldit is a online-based puzzle game, where participants engage in simulated 
   protein folding in order to predict protein structure.
   <br/>
   Predicting the lowest energy state of a protein is a task computers are poor at, 
   but people are good at. Foldit is an attempt to gamify the process of predicting 
   protein structures to crowdsource the data-gathering.
   <br/>
   Foldit is the creation of biochemist, David Baker, and game designer, Zoran 
   Popovic, both of whom work at the University of Washington in Seattle. The game 
   is downloaded onto a player’s personal computer and then allow the player to 
   manipulate protein structures.
   <br/>
   There are a series of levels a player moves through, with the earliest levels 
   acting as training rounds, where players work on already-known proteins in 
   order to learn the basics of protein folding skills. The game involves a 
   point-system, where the highest number of points are awarded to those with proteins
   that have been manipulated to have the lowest-energy configurations.
   <br/>
   As described in an article by the Scientific American website, “The Foldit 
   exploration puzzle game attempts to predict the structure of a protein by 
   taking advantage of our puzzle-solving intuitions and having people play 
   competitively to fold the best proteins. Players can also design brand new 
   proteins that could help prevent or treat important diseases.”

   Headquartered in San Francisco, GroupTalent is a hiring platform that lists 
   contract-for-hire opportunities so a developer can try out working with a 
   company before they commit to a longer-term job.
   <br/>
   If you are an employer seeking a programmer, a company pays GroupTalent to 
   list the job opportunity on the platform. Using an algorithm, GroupTalent 
   then matches the listing description with actively-looking programmers who 
   are registered on GroupTalent after being vetted by the platform’s staff. 
   The employer can then invite a programmer for an interview for a 
   contract-to-hire opportunity. At the end of the predefined period of time, 
   the employer can extend an offer for longer-term employment.
   <br/>
   Now based in San Francisco, GroupTalent was developed out of TechStars 
   Seattle and raised $1 million in funding from Version One Ventures, Menlo 
   Ventures, and Founder’s Co-op.

- title: I Paid a Bribe
  url: http://www.ipaidabribe.com
  description: >
   Janaagraha is a non-profit that works for improving the quality of 
   citizenship and infrastructure and services in India’s cities. Janaagraha 
   runs two on-line platforms, ICHangeMyCity.com and IPaidABribe.com. 
   IPaidABribe.com is a platform provided to citizens to crowd source bribe 
   experiences. It is a citizen driven mechanism for tracking bribe payment 
   activity, also instances of when people resisted bribe payments or did 
   not have to pay bribes because of good government systems or good people 
   within the government systems. Citizens’ reports on the nature, number, 
   pattern, types, locations and frequency of actual corrupt acts and values 
   of bribes will add up to a valuable knowledge bank that will contribute 
   to a reduction in bribe payments.
   <br/>
   By providing a place for citizens to report, as well as by analyzing the 
   information, ipaidabribe.com aims to
   * Heighten citizen awareness about the nature and spread of bribe-related 
   exchanges and promote a purposive public debate that pressurises public 
   officials to reduce and eventually eliminate corruption.
   * Help citizens to recognize, avoid and tackle bribe paying situations.
   * Identify and analyse the workflows within corruption prone public services, 
   to make suggestions on systemic reform directed at entrenching simpler and 
   more transparent processes, more consistent standards of law enforcement 
   and better vigilance and regulation.

   The ipaidabribe.com idea has emerged and evolved over time. It commenced 
   with a discussion between co-founders of Janaagraha, Swati and Ramesh 
   Ramanathan and Mr. Sridar Iyengar, a board member of Janaagraha’s advisory 
   board a couple of years back regarding the pernicious effect of corruption 
   on destroying city life and disempowering citizens. The original idea was 
   that the website could become a simple means of tracking the market price 
   of corruption - a kind of market price prediction mechanism. A small 
   experimental website was put up to test the idea. However the afterthought 
   was that such an effort was indeed a very powerful one. Over time, we worked 
   on the idea extensively and added a lot more features. We decided that the 
   website has to be a multifaceted site, providing a variety of services to 
   people. We launched the new completely redesigned website on Aug 15, 2010, 
   India’s Independence day. 
   <br/>
   IPaidABribe.com (IPAB) is an initiative to tackle corruption by tapping 
   into the collective energy of citizens, almost every one of whom is either 
   a victim, perpetrator or beneficiary, or a combination of these. Janaagraha 
   has a very rigorous system of aligning its institutional objectives with 
   the performance of its programmes. Each institutional objective is further 
   aligned with several strategic themes. Ipab aligns with Janaagraha’s goal 
   of making a measurable difference in the quality of Citizenship in cities. 
   It does this by adopting the strategy of empowering citizens using a 
   net-plus- roots approach – we use a net based platform for recording the 
   grassroots experiences of citizens. Through this approach, ipaidabribe.com 
   aligns completely with Janaagraha’s key thrust of increasing the number of 
   citizen change agents in the city. We believe that every citizen who reports 
   a story on our website about paying a bribe, is angry enough to begin to 
   resist it. Of course, it goes without saying that somebody who has resisted 
   paying a bribe and reported the story, is already very much on the path of 
   being a citizen change agent.

   more transparent processes, more consistent standards of law enforcement 
   and better vigilance and regulation.
   Summarising the above, the three fold impact strategy of the platform 
   covers three broad strands 
   a) Education. Through How To's and information, make citizens aware 
   of the government procedures so that bribes are not paid through ignorance. 
   b) Policy Reform. Use of data collected and trend analysis to plug the avenues 
   of corruption.
   c) Redressal. Escalate individual reports to the authorities and department 
   heads who can initiate enquiries/ legal proceedings against the accused.
  impact_today: >
   A legal impact can be seen only if legal complaints increase and prosecutions 
   happen. Right now, we are engaging in creating a groundswell against corruption, 
   both working with the government to reduce red tape as also with citizens to 
   build up their courage and helping them to overcome corruption. We believe that 
   corruption has grown this big only because as citizens, we have tolerated it. 
   If we actively oppose it and there are enough of us, the government has to 
   buckle down and tackle the problem effectively. To do that, it is also important 
   that we build bridges with and support the actions of honest officials within the 
   government, who often look the other way, because they are dispirited and become 
   cynical. 
   <br/>
   The Transport Commissioner in Bangalore called to communicate his embarrassment 
   at finding his department having the highest instances of bribe taking in 
   Bangalore. We worked with him and his senior management team to re-engineer the 
   process flow and reduce the loopholes for rent seeking in the issuance of drivers’ 
   licenses, so that 2 key steps that in the past had a fair amount of subjective 
   discretion in them, were converted to automated tests. 
   <br/>
   As another example, the department for land registration used to have designated 
   offices where one had to go to register the purchase and sale of land – depending 
   on where in the city the particular land parcel was, one had to go to a specific 
   Sub Registrar’s Office. With the ipaidabribe.com data, it was evident that there 
   was a flourishing market for bribes in land transactions, reflecting admirably 
   the laws of supply and demand! Those Sub Registrar offices that were on the periphery 
   of the city, where much of the new growth occurs, were seeing thegreatest rates of 
   bribes, whereas those Sub Registrar Offices which were in the heart of the city, 
   where land transactions are less frequent, were seeing fewer touts and lower rates. 
   So we made a proposal to the Department of Stamps and Registration – given that 
   all land transactions had been converted to electronic records, why not make them 
   ‘Anywhere Registration’? That is, one could go to any Sub Registrar office in the 
   city to register one’s land transaction.

   Our intent is to change the system that breeds corruption, rather than indict the 
   individuals within the system. Besides, even if you change the individuals, the 
   threat of corruption still remains. But change the system and you root out 
   corruption permanently. 
   <br/>
   The role that non-government bodies play is multi-fold since corruption is such 
   a vast and hydra-headed monster - from procurement processes in public projects, 
   to extraction of precious natural resources, to public services, and favouritism/ 
   nepotism towards private enterprise – these are all rife with corruption as 
   instruments for wealth and/or power.

   Currently with our net presence alone, we do realize that we only touch people 
   who have access to the net. With the pace of internet penetration in India, 
   this number is likely to grow rapidly. 
   <br/>
   Mobile phone usage in the country is on a surge, we have hence also developed 
   a mobile app to enable people to report their stories via their smart phone. 
   For those who do not have a smart phone, reports can be shared through a bribe 
   hotline, via a call.
   <br/>
   With over 34000 reports on the website, many reports are received from citizens 
   in the major cities (especially the IT hubs of Bangalore, Hyderabad and Chennai). 
   Followed by tier 2 cities in states. 
   <br/>
   While we do get a lot of page views ( consuming the content on the platform) 
   reporting of instances of bribe transactions is still in its nascent stages.

   The biggest challenge for IPaidaBribe.com is to respond to the demands of the 
   public, to provide support and information quickly. As this is a web based 
   initiative, it is important that we respond to people very fast. For this purpose, 
   one needs to collect data from the government, analyse government procedures 
   and present the findings in a simple manner. At any given time, we are undertaking 
   research on at least two to three important government procedures or departments.

   The original idea for this crowdsourcing project came from Alph Bingham and 
   Aaron Schacht, coworkers in the pharmaceutical Eli Lilly and Company. Coming 
   from the pharmaceutical industry, Bingham and Schacht had a first hand perspective 
   on the challenge that R&D budgets represent to companies. In the pharmaceutical 
   industry one of their perennial efforts is to improve the cycle time for drug 
   discovery and development. This effort comes with the challenge of reducing the 
   enormous costs that failures in the R&D departments of the pharmaceutical industry 
   represent in monetary terms. 
   <br/>
   Having in mind the particular problems that the pharmaceutical industry faces in
   creating value from their expensive R&D, Bingham and Schach created a prototype of
   the platform in 1998 after collaboratively thinking of ways in which to incorporate 
   Internet into business strategies. In 2001 InnoCentive was launched by Jill Panetta, 
   Jeff Hensley, Darren Carroll, and Alph Bingham. One of the motives behind the creation 
   of this platform for communal work was to enable what the Internet provides: a global 
   marketplace of qualified individuals that can produce faster and cheaper innovation.

   can deliver benefits to the research, commercial and community sectors—and 
   to citizens at large.
   <br/>
   The government also hoped to address some of the challenges raised by open 
   access to PSI, and awarded bonuses to entrants that sought to transform, 
   enrich and enhance data sets into more useful and open formats in the process 
   of building their entries.
   <br/>
   Finally, the government also aimed to drive community engagement, an ongoing goal 
   of the Government 2.0 Taskforce.

   Of the 82 mashups entered, two won the grand $10,000 prize:
   * Suburban Trends: “A mashup of different types of crime and census data 
   that allows you to compare and contrast suburbs by a range of economic, 
   education, safety and socio-economic indicators. The judges thought the 
   ability to compare suburbs visually combined with the selective choice of 
   statistics was excellent especially in a field dominated by many entries 
   using similar datasets.”
   * Know Where You Live: “This entry bills itself as a prototype of a mashup 
   of a range of open access government data based on postcodes so that you 
   can truly know where you live. The judges loved the very citizen-centric 
   “common questions” user experience of this app and the groovy, and again, 
   selective repackaging of what could otherwise be considered (we’ll be 
   honest here) slightly boring data.”

   The greatest impediment to the program is that Australia lacks a central 
   hub for all challenges, but instead has one-off sites and programs. This 
   compounds other problems, most notably those regarding resource allocation; 
   for example, individual agencies are not empowered to launch their own 
   challenges, and most challenges tend to be short-lived.

   Neighbor.ly is the fundraising toolkit for community projects of Luminopolis. 
   The idea came to Jase Wilson from a series of fortunate circumstances: hearing a talk of Rob 
   Goodspeed about civic crowdsourcing, attending a public meeting to discuss the funding of a 
   streetcar, watching a video game break a record for funding at Kickstarter and a breakfast he had 
   with Patrick Hosty one of the advisors of the site. At this breakfast, Wilson 
   and Hosty where discussing a bond deal when a person overheard their conversation
   and started discussing with them. This person decided not to vote for that particular bond deal
   because it lumped sewer repairs with paying for other civic amenities, like buying new animals
   for the zoo. Hosty and this person got into a heated discussion which gave Wilson the idea
   for the site. The site was thought to fund civic projects one really cared about.

   NYC BigApps is New York City's premier open data competition. Created in 2009, 
   NYC BigApps has helped launch nearly 300 apps that improve the lives of New 
   York residents, visitors and businesses. The NYC BigApps competition has also 
   opened up over 1,000 datasets to developers around the world.
   <br/>
   As part of the discussion that the crowdsourcing model can tap the possibilities 
   for digital communication networks to mobilize citizens, foster creative input 
   and produce plans through democratic processes, which more accurately address 
   our lived experience within organized networks today. A few scholars studying 
   collective intelligence in governance,including Clark and Logan cite the 
   successes of the crowdsourcing platform Ushahidi and of the ideation initiative 
   NYCBigApps as evidence that crowdsourcing can transform government to be more 
   engaging, more democratic, and more effective.
   <br/>
   The Challenge is also a test of the concept of prize-backed challenges, that 
   help create the incentive for insightful enthusiasts to emerge from the 
   woodwork. The use of prizes in the public sector is growing more common, as 
   evidenced by the New York City’s BigApps challenge, although we still do not 
   have a strong understanding of their optimal uses.

   on a web channel, and nine were chosen by an expert panel. Programs were piloted 
   at nine participating NHS organizations and funded from August 2012 to March 
   2013, when the NHS Institute was disbanded. The projects were selected following 
   their bid for a share of the £1 million Challenge fund which was set aside to 
   support the most promising approaches to measuring and improving patient

   More than 2,200 individuals participated in determining the best project ideas 
   on the Challenge’s web channel. However, the web channel proved to be a challenge 
   for some participation projects due to technical difficulties with the actual 
   site and a lack of familiarity with social networking.
   <br/>
   Nine NHS projects were ultimately chosen to share the one million pound grant.
   These nine pilot projects impacted 75 wards, services, and divisions across NHS.
  impact_today: >
   Because funding was time-limited to the closure of the NHS Institute, the long 
   term impacts of the specific NHS Challenge projects is still to be determined. 
   However, the funding provided did enable organizations to have the flexibility 
   to test new approaches to patient-care where they otherwise could not afford 
   to do.
   <br/>
   Ultimately, as a government entity, the NHS Institute is not the final 
   decision-maker in its own resources. In April 2013, the Institute was disbanded. 
   The projects continue, but do not have the same access to NHS Institute resources.
   <br/>
   The United Kingdom’s Office of Public Management, which evaluated the Patient 
   Feedback Challenge from June 2012 to February 2013, concluded that a web portal 
   that allowed projects to share ideas and experiences is beneficial and welcomed 
   by participation parties. Yet, NHS Institute’s untested web channel was fraught 
   with initial technical issues, “leading some to lose faith in it and ultimately 
   fail to use it to its full potential. We suggest that in future programmes, 
   introducing a more straightforward online portal with clear guidance about how 
   to use it and fewer technical glitches, is likely to encourage uptake and use.

   issued patents by enabling the public to supply the USPTO with information relevant to 
   assessing the claims of pending patent applications.

   An initial pilot examined more than 220 patent applications in the fields of software 
   and business methods. The Peer To Patent project has issued two anniversary reports 
   from the initial pilot and a final report from the initial pilot is pending.

   In 2005, before Facebook and Twitter, New York Law School students and the chair
   of the Research Network, Beth Noveck, designed and later launched Peer to Patent, 
   the first expert network in government, which connected volunteer scientists 
   and technologists to national patent offices to better inform how they decide 
   who gets the twenty year grant of the monopoly right called a patent. They 
   invented the process, technology and the policy by which a closed bureaucracy could 
   open its doors and collaborate with knowledgeable people to do its work better. Time 
   after time, the public was able to dig up quickly the expertise the official could
   not find, enabling him/her to make the final determination informed by citizen 
   participation but subject to the independent law and rules of the patent process. 
   Despite the fact that patent practice had not changed much since Thomas Jefferson 
   began as the first examiner in 1791, under the new Patent Act, passed with near 
   unanimity – Peer to Patent citizen engagement, once an experimental pilot undertaken

   * 21% of participating examiners stated that prior art submitted by the Peer To Patent community was

   Foundation in April 2010. The original idea for PulsePoint came from Richard 
   Price, former chief of San Ramon Valley Fire Department, in order to connect 
   those who are trained in CPR with those who are in need of emergency cardiac 
   assistance.
   <br/>
   The first edition of the App “did not contain the location-aware CPR/AED 
   notification capability” and was available exclusively through Apple’s App 
   Store within iTunes. Subsequent versions have location awareness features and 
   are available to Android users in addition to Apple users. San Jose, 
   California became the first community to utilize the app in 2012.
   <br/>
   The Pulse Point app is connected with a middle tier website and a dispatch 
   interface, which allows 911 dispatchers to input cardiac emergency information 
   (including location) into the app. The app uses GPS to notify registered users 
   within walking distance (usually about 0.5 miles away, depending on population 
   density) of both the location of the cardiac emergency and also the location 
   of nearby publicly accessible Automated External Defibrillator (AED).

  description: >
   Quora is a user-driven question-and-answer website. Quora is a Mountain View, 
   California based company that seeks to increase access to knowledge over the 
   internet. Quora is often contrasted to websites like Wikipedia, in that Quora 
   promotes the exchange of knowledge, while Wikipedia is a repository for 
   information. Whereas Wikipedia attempts to construct neutral, objective articles, 
   Quora allows individuals to offer their own personal perspective on any given issue. 
   Quora’s core function is the exchange of questions and answers: users post questions 
   to the broader Quora community, and these questions can then be answered by any 
   other Quora user with relevant knowledge to share. These answers are then “voted up” 
   or “voted down” by other users. This voting process allows the “best” answers to 
   achieve the widest circulation.

   Quora was founded in June 2009 by Adam D’Angelo and Charlie Cheever, and was 
   rolled out to the general public in June 2010. Both D’Angelo and Cheever were 
   employed at Facebook prior to the launch of Quora. The company was initially 
   financed by an $11 million investment from Benchmark Capital, a Venture Capital 
   firm specializing in tech-based startups (other recipients of Benchmark 
   investments include Instagram, Zipcar, Yelp, and Twitter). Quora currently has 
   102 employees, and has not yet monetized its service, choosing instead to 
   continue relying on outside investors. On 4/9/14, Quora received an additional 
   $80 million in funding, spearheaded by private equity firm and hedge fund Tiger 
   Global. Multiple sources have reported that Quora will likely turn to advertising 
   to generate revenue by 2015.

  impact_today: >
   Quora has become one of the most popular Q&A platforms and has attracted a number 
   of notable celebrities, including Ashoton Kutcher, Mark Zuckerberg, and President 
   Obama. It has carved out a niche among social networking sites; by focusing on a 
   Q&A format, it continues to promote the exchange of information, and not simply 
   encourage social interaction. Quora’s essential value proposition, making it 
   easier for people to seek out and/or share specific human knowledge, is ultimately 
   difficult to quantify. It is safe to say however, that Quora has enabled people 
   to solicit the wisdom of highly specialized experts, and made it easier for people 
   with specific knowledge to share what they know.

   From a business perspective, Quora’s most significant challenge in the near 
   future will be monetizing its business and beginning to generate revenue. 
   To date, the company has relied exclusively on outside investment to finance 
   its operations. Quora will likely choose to monetize its site through advertising; 
   transitioning to an advertising-based model while not disrupting the user 
   experience will be a challenge for the company.
   <br/>
   Observers have offered a number of criticisms of Quora’s functionality 
   and culture:
   * Some have argued that Quora is dominated by an elite of early adopters, 
   who punish dissenting voices by downgrading their answers and through 
   bullying tactics.
   * Others have argued that Quora’s core Q&A format, though fantastic as 
   a research tool or as a way to share knowledge, is inherently less scale-able 
   than purely social platforms like Facebook or Twitter. People habitually make 
   use of these social networking sites, but are likely to turn to Quora only for 
   more specific needs.
   * Other users have criticized Quora’s policy of requiring smartphone users to 
   view Q&A threads through their mobile app, and not allowing access through 
   browsers.
   * In August 2012, Ivan Kirigin criticized Quora on his blog, Giant Robot 
   Lasers, pointing out that Quora published information on which questions users 
   viewed. Kirigin argued that this practice constituted a major invasion of 
   privacy, “What if the question were ‘How can I cope with newly discovered 
   cancer?’ Or, ‘Should I come out to my parents?’ Or, ‘What is the best way 
   to hide an affair?’” To Quora’s credit, it responded by discontinuing 
   this practice.

   collect their data. 
   <br/>
   Safecast deploys teams of volunteers to record nuanced data such as 
   radiation counts per minute, raw levels of radiation, becquerels, and 
   microsieverts, which together tell a complete story about radiation levels. 
   Volunteers strap Safecast’s custom ‘bento box’ (referred to as such due to 
   their resemblance to bento boxes) Geiger counters to their vehicles and 
   collect radiation data in their communities. Volunteers also use handheld 
   Geiger counters to collect data on foot.
   <br/> 
   Safecast’s fine-grained data collection methodology is particularly 
   valuable because radiation data levels can vary widely across a single city. 
   Safecast volunteers collect data street by street and at multiple points 
   within a single zone, which creates a more nuanced portrait of actual 
   radiation levels within a region. November 10, 2011. Radiation levels 
   can even differ between neighborhoods, thus rendering city-level data 
   only valuable in ascertaining an approximation of radiation levels 
   city-wide. Collecting data at the neighborhood-level ensures the data 
   is fine-grained and it provides an accurate profile of threats.

   Founded in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi meltdown, Safecast was 
   created to provide fine-grained radiation data to regions impacted by the 
   nuclear power plant meltdown. Two years later, the volunteer-run organization 
   is still leveraging the power of crowdsoucing to provide post-Fukushima 
   radiation data, but has broadened its scope to provide baseline radiation data 
   and also measure other environmental factors like air quality. Due to the scale 
   of the disaster in Fukushima, the majority of the organization’s efforts are 
   still directed at providing granular radiation data so that those impacted by 
   the meltdown can make data-driven decisions.
   <br/>
   In the aftermath of the 9.0 magnitude earthquake and subsequent meltdown at 
   the Fukushima nuclear power plant, there was little publicly available data about 
   radiation levels in Japan. This dearth of radiation data concerned friends Sean 
   Bonner, Pieter Franken, and Joi Ito, all of whom had close ties to the region. 
   Geiger counters that enable radiation data collection were in short supply and 
   little official information about radiation levels was being shared with the 
   public. Spurred by the gap in readily available radiation data and the short 
   supply of Geiger counters, Bonner, Franken, and Ito took it upon themselves to 
   build the hardware they needed to monitor radiation levels in Japan. In 
   partnership with Tokyo Hackerspace, Safecast designed and built high quality 
   Geiger counters to enable citizens to collect radiation data within their 
   communities.
   <br/> 
   Constructing the hardware was one element of Safecast’s work. The other 
   component was assembling an expert network to help monitor the situation 
   unfolding in Japan. Within a week of the Fukushima disaster Safecast mobilized 
   a crowdsourced team of 25 experts committed to voluntarily monitor radiation 
   levels across Japan. This network quickly ballooned to include experts from 
   around the world, and Safecast rapidly grew to become the largest citizen 
   science monitoring network of its kind. This rapid growth can be attributed 
   to a number of factors, but most notably, it was the dearth of official 
   information on radiation levels that led to citizens creating their 
   own crowdsourced network.

   a wealth of information on a given issue, and allows for users to interact with 
   existing problems on the site, potentially amplifying their importance for 
   governments.
   <br/>
   SeeClickFix is a growing platform that allows citizens to publicly report a wide 
   variety of civic issues and then monitor their development. The most active cities 
   on the platform are Chicago, Illinois; Washington, DC; Malden, Massachusetts; Macon, 
   Georgia and Winston-Salem, North Carolina.
   <br/> 
   The SeeClickFix website prompts users to enter their neighborhood into a form, 
   which leads them to a site featuring a searchable collection of user-generated 
   issues that allow for citizen comments, featuring an issue “up-voting” system. 
   The collection of issues can be viewed in list form, on a map or as a gallery of 
   uploaded images. Each individual issue entry can feature user-supplied images, 
   the ability to view the issue on a map, information on when it was reported and 
   by whom, a list of notified stakeholders, the ability for users to follow the 
   issue and links to other nearby problems reported on the site. Each neighborhood 
   also features an “Answers” user forum, a list of “Neighbors” using the site and a 
   collection of mapped “Watch Areas” for user monitoring.
   <br/>
   SeeClickFix also offers mobile apps for IOS, Android, Windows Phone and Blackberry
   that allow citizens to report issues, browse open problems, view a list of active
   neighbors and send and receive messages. The company also provides links on its 
   website for governments to request custom mobile apps for their area.

   Spacehive is the first Civic Crowdfunding platform, allowing communities to raise

   Spacehive has provided a platform for over 230 civic initiatives in the United 
   Kingdom.
   <br/> 
   Spacehive is a United Kingdom-based civic crowdfunding platform that allows 
   citizens to contribute to neighborhood improvement projects. A first of its kind, 
   the Spacehive platform allows anyone to pitch an idea and request community support. 
   In return, community members can pledge funding. If the project funding target is 
   reached, the project gets the green light.
   <br/>
   The critical component of a project on Spacehive is that the proposal is for a 
   public space, i.e. the community can access freely. Online proposals must include 
   a description of the project, an explanation of how the money will be used to meet 
   project goals, and a pitch on why the project is needed. Examples include Christmas 
   decorations on a town bridge that were previously cut for austerity measures, 
   launching a free WiFi zone at a local mall, and a campaign to save a community theater 
   company.
   <br/>
   There are no fees to post and donate to the project. However, Spacehive charges an 
   administrative fee if a project fits its fundraising goal. According to the 
   Spacehive website, these administrative fees total 3.7% on the first 500,000 
   pounds raised, 2.5% on the next 500,000 pounds, and 1.5% thereafter. Current project 
   goals range from 90 pounds to more than 600,000 pounds.

   Stack Exchange is an information exchange platform founded by Jeff Atwood and 
   Joel Spolsky. Users can ask questions on a given topic, and receive crowd-vetted 
   answers.
   <br/> 
   Stack Exchange is a network of expert Q&A communities, each categorized by a 
   specific professionalized field. As of July 2014, there are 125 Q&A sites within 
   the Stack Exchange Network, with subjects as varied as programming to cooking. 
   On each discrete topic site, any user can ask a question, to which the community 
   submits answers. The community ranks the answers that are the best fit for the 
   question, so the answer with the most votes becomes the most visible, and the 
   least applicable answer is voted down. The questions and answers can also be 
   amended by the community, wiki-style.
   <br/>
   The Stack Exchange community is self-governed. Governance is based on site 
   reputation. Reputation is earned by other community members voting on that users 
   previous activity. A user gains more rights as their reputation builds. Rights 
   include deleting, editing, and running for moderator, an elected individual who 
   has increased access to managing a Q&A site.

   Stack Exchange evolved from Stack Overflow, a Q&A platform designed for the 
   software programming community that was launched on September 15, 2008 by 
   Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky.
  output: >
   As of July 2014 the Q&A sites support over 3.5 million users, 8 million 
   questions, and 15 million answers. According to co-founder Joel Spolsky, 
   90-95% of questions asked on the site have answers labeled as reputable.
   <br/>
   In addition, there are 574 unpublished sites - labeled “Area 51” sites - 
   that have been proposed by a member of the community but have not yet proven 
   their ability to amass experts willing to be active.
   <br/>
   The process to become a Stack Exchange site is extensive. If an individual 
   or community is interested in launching a new topic for a Q&A site, they 
   first need to provide examples of questions that would likely be proposed on 
   that site to indicate a defined community. The topic also needs to have a 
   community of experts committed to participating in the information exchange, 
   which is done through signing a petition. Community managers at Stack Exchange 
   gauge the likelihood of activity for the Area 51 site by the individuals who 
   sign the petition. If there are a number of individuals who show a history 
   of activity on Stack Exchange, the site will be approved. However, the site 
   initially be open only to those individuals who signed the petition to populate 
   the platform with enough useful questions and answers so there is already 
   information available when the site is open to the public.
  impact_today: >
   The Stack Exchange Network provides responsive and high-quality answers to 
   specific questions. While only a handful of individuals will ask and answer 
   questions on the site, thousands will be able to view the information 
   exchange. This is a mutual benefit, where active users participate in expanding 
   shared knowledge base, while passive users still garner answers to their questions.
   <br/>
   Much of the success of Stack Exchange Q&A sites can be attributed to the 
   professionalized fields the sites encompass. By tapping into a network of 
   professionals and hobbyists with a shared knowledge and vested interest in 
   exchanging information in their field, the number of quality questions asked and 
   credible answers received increases.

   TopCoder is a digital open innovation platform that provides companies and 
   enterprises with access to global talent instantly to develop innovative software 
   applications within a distributive innovation system.
   <br/>
   TopCoder is the world’s largest platform for digital open innovation. It provides 
   a community of hundreds of thousands of software developers, algorithmists and 
   digital designers a way to accelerate the development of new products and services 
   by launching a specialized competition – through a prized-based business model – where 
   companies and enterprises get highly trained experts working in their projects.
   <br/>
   The solutions created by the TopCoder community of experts are delivered through 
   highly scalable processes overseen by TopCoder and clients themselves provide 
   guidance and feedback through the entire process of software development from 
   concept, designs and build to delivery, enhancement and maintenance of digital 
   offerings in support of their different products and services.
   <br/>
   According to Professor Karim Lakhani, the incentives for the expert community 
   to participate in TopCoder are heterogeneous ranging from the monetary incentive, 
   having a sense of community, the learning from the process and just for the fun 
   of it. Having people participating with different motivations is important for 
   the resilience of the platform.

   Harvard Medical School used TopCoder to host a 2 week competition to improve 
   the processing speed of a big data biomedics program. With $6,000 in total 
   prize money, 733 registrants and 122 members submitting working algorithms, 
   TopCoder provided HMS with a winning solution that performed hundreds of times 
   faster and at a higher degree of accuracy than the best-known existing solution, 
   reducing the time to execution from 2000 seconds to just over 16 seconds.

   Open innovation platforms like TopCoder have shown unconventional individuals 
   are often the ones providing the most innovative answers. The diversity within 
   TopCoder’s community of experts provides unexpected and fresh ways of approaching 
   and solving a problem. Lars Bo Jeppesen and Karim Lakhani found that a positive 
   relationship exists between a solver’s chance of winning a challenge and a wide 
   distance between the solver’s field of technical expertise and the focal field 
   of the problem.

   Threadless was created in 2000 by two dropout students from Chicago, Jake Nickel and Jacob DeHart.
   After winning a design contest for the New Media Underground festival, Jake Nickel, 
   CEO of the company, partnered with a friend to create a design contest where people 
   could submit their original creations to be printed on a t-shirt . Nickel and his 
   Threadless co-founder, Jacob DeHart, used to be assiduous community members of 
   dreamless.org, an online discussion forum where designers and programmers interacted 
   with each other creating an online community where their members participated in
   collective tasks and discussed a series of communal topics. The idea of Threadless.com 
   was to create an activity to engage their peers in the process of creating “original” T-shirts as a fun hobby, 
   not to create a business.

   On December 8, 2009 President Obama, in a memorandum to the Director of the 
   Office of Management & Budget, issued a directive for agency heads and 
   departments to implement principles of transparency, participation, and 
   collaboration with the public. The memorandum put forth 3 requirements that 
   agencies had to abide by: publish government information online, improve 
   quality of government information, create and institutionalize a culture of 
   open government, and create an enabling policy framework for open government. 
   Within these guidelines he included deadlines, and a framework for which each 
   agency must adopt an open government plan.

   Since President Obama put forth his directive in 2009, the administration has 
   stayed true to its commitment to building upon and expanding OpenGov. In 2013, 
   the administration put forth a second Open Government National Action Plan, 
   building on an earlier initiative to make government more transparent. Both 
   documents were published to help meet the standards of the Open Government 
   Project, an international agreement founded by the US and seven other 
   countries in 2011.

   XPRIZEs are massive financial awards provided by the XPRIZE Foundation and a

   prizes are used to incentivize projects that could benefit humanity. Prizes 
   are given out following a competition, wherein individuals propose potential 
   projects or solutions to public problems. For example, the Ansari XPRIZE for 
   space exploration is one of the most famous examples of prize-induced contests.
   <br/>
   XPRIZEs are awarded in five different groups: Education, Energy and Environment,
   Exploration, Global Development and Life Sciences. Currently active XPRIZEs 
   include the Google Lunar XPRIZE, Archon Genomics XPRIZE presented by Express 
   Scripts, Qualcomm Tricorder XPRIZE and the Nokia Sensing XPRIZE. Already awarded 
   XPRIZEs include the Ansari XPRIZE, Progressive Insurance Automotive XPRIZE, Wendy 
   Schmidt Oil Cleanup XCHALLENGE and the Northrop Grumman Lunar Lander XCHALLENGE.

   Chairman and CEO Peter Diamandis first announced the Ansari XPRIZE in 1996. 
   The $10 million prize for building and launching a spacecraft capable of 
   carrying three people to 100 kilometers above the earth’s surface, twice 
   within two weeks, was awarded to Scaled Composites on October 4, 2004. 
   Following the success of the project, the XPRIZE Foundation grew and began 
   offering prizes in a wider variety of areas.

   XPRIZEs likely remain the most popularly known form of open innovation contests 
   or challenges. The incredible success of the original Ansari XPRIZE—which 
   spawned over $100 million in development efforts by contestants—likely played 
   a significant role in catalyzing the wider use of price-induced contests and 
   challenges. XPRIZEs have “facilitated an oil recovery cleanup at quadruple the 
   standard rate. Enabled the creation of a 135 MPGe energy-efficient car. And 
   helped launch a $1.5 billion private space industry.”

   The scope and difficulty of XPRIZE challenges traditionally lead to teams or 
   organizations winning the prize, as was the case with the original Ansari XPRIZE. 
   However, considering the level of complexity involved in each challenge, 
   unaffiliated individuals could possibly provide useful input if given the 
   opportunity to collaborate, but the website provides no on-site means of 
   collaboration or team building.

   Zooniverse is a website that houses the various projects run by the Citizen 
   Science Alliance.
   <br/>
   The Zooniverse website connects volunteers, or “zooites,” to a variety of 
   Citizen Science Alliance’s projects. The original project, Galaxy Zoo, had 
   volunteers classify galaxies by leading them through on online tutorial of 
   visual cues to determine galaxy type, testing the participant’s newly acquired 
   skills with a trial, and finally having the participants apply this knowledge 
   to unclassified galaxies. While the original Galaxy Zoo project is archived, 
   there have been several variations including two that are still in progress, 
   Galaxy Zoo, Hubble and Moon Zoo.
   <br/>
   In addition to Galaxy Zoo and its spin-offs, there are many other projects 
   that deal with astronomical categorization using the same technique of training 
   volunteers to identify certain characteristics and then use that knowledge to 
   classify specific celestial objects (galaxies, moons, etc.). The same model 
   is also utilized for projects in other fields such as ecology, climate science, 
   and marine biology. In the case of marine biology, the model was adjusted for a 
   project entitled Whale FM so that participants learned audio instead of visual 
   cues. There are also multiple transcription projects currently underway, 
   including Old Weather and Ancient Lives, which rely on volunteers to transcribe 
   documents.
   <br/>
   The Zooniverse/Citizen Science Alliance team determines which projects will 
   be housed in Zooniverse by having scientists submit proposals through online 
   questionnaires. Zooniverse works with scientists and scholars from a wide 
   variety of fields, including astronomy, humanities, climate science, planetary 
   science, classics, and ecology.
